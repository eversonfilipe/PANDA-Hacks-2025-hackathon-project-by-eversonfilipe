# CORE FEATURES (EPICS) DEFINITION

The following **Epics** directly prioritize overcoming the *"Teacher AI Literacy Gap"*, ensuring that educators are equipped to use AI for personalized learning. The solution indirectly impacts low-income public school students by providing an accessible and sustainable approach within the scope of the hackathon. All efforts align with the *"Agentic AI"* and *"No/Low Code"* tracks and embed ESG principles by promoting educational equity.

## EPIC 1: AI-Powered Content Personalization & Adaptation Engine

**Description:**

Develop a robust backend system that leverages AI/ML (e.g., NLP for text, computer vision for visual content) to analyze educational materials and student performance data (anonymized for privacy). The system will suggest or automatically adapt content difficulty, format (text, video, interactive), and examples based on each student’s learning style, pace, and curiosity triggers.

Teachers will have access to *low-code* options to review, edit, and approve AI suggestions, offering a transparent *"content co-pilot"* experience.

**Value Proposition:**

Directly tackles the *Personalized Learning Gap* by delivering tailored content. Empowers teachers by giving them control over AI adaptations, fostering trust and AI literacy through hands-on use.

**Key Deliverables (MVP for Hackathon):**

- Basic content ingestion (e.g., text-based lessons).
- Rule-based personalization (e.g., simplified vocabulary for lower reading levels, added examples by topic).
- Teacher-facing dashboard for reviewing and adjusting AI suggestions.
- Simple analytics on student engagement with personalized content (e.g., completion rates).

## EPIC 2: Interactive Teacher AI Literacy & Support Module

**Description:**

Create a gamified, in-platform learning module for teachers, focused on foundational AI literacy and pedagogical integration strategies. The module will include interactive tutorials, mini-challenges, and practical scenarios to explore the full use of *ImpactAI EduFlow* features. It will provide real-time feedback, a community forum, and expert mentorship via *virtual office hours*.

This module directly addresses the *Teacher AI Literacy Gap*.

**Value Proposition:**

Targets the root cause by systematically building teachers' AI literacy. Reduces resistance to change and boosts classroom adoption of AI tools. Provides sustained support.

**Key Deliverables (MVP for Hackathon):**

- Interactive introductory course: “AI for Personalized Learning” (e.g., “What is AI?”, “How can AI help my students?”).
- Guided walkthroughs for platform core features.
- Integrated chat/forum for teacher questions and peer collaboration.
- Progress tracking for teacher learning modules.

## EPIC 3: Student Progress & Engagement Analytics Dashboard

**Description:**

Design an intuitive dashboard for teachers with clear visualizations of student progress and engagement with personalized content. The dashboard will offer actionable insights into learning patterns, struggles, and curiosity peaks, enabling intervention or advanced challenges. Data will be presented using privacy-first principles (e.g., anonymized group trends).

**Value Proposition:**

Allows teachers to monitor personalized learning effectiveness. Supports data-driven decision-making to improve teaching strategies and offer targeted support, especially for under-resourced students lacking external help.

**Key Deliverables (MVP for Hackathon):**

- Visual representation of content completion and quiz scores.
- Identification of “struggling” or “highly engaged” students (based on predefined metrics).
- Basic filters (e.g., by class, by topic).
- Exportable reports for administrative use.

## EPIC 4: Accessible Interface & Offline/Low-Connectivity Support

**Description:**

Prioritize a clean, intuitive user interface (UI) for both teachers and students, designed for simplicity and ease of use. Implement a robust *offline-first* or low-connectivity mode, including content caching, local data sync, and a simplified UX for smooth operation regardless of internet quality.

**Value Proposition:**

Directly addresses the *Solution Access* gap for low-income students in underserved regions. Ensures inclusivity and universal usability, regardless of infrastructure limitations. Aligned with ESG principles by promoting digital equity.

**Key Deliverables (MVP for Hackathon):**

- Responsive web interface for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Offline support with delayed sync.
- Intuitive navigation and UX adapted for low bandwidth environments.
